# Fractions
You shouuld only make changes to `Fraction.java`.  Implement each method as described in the assignment description.

**Note**: the sample code uses another keyword we haven't discussed yet, `final`.  A variable/field that is declared to be
`final` cannot have its value changed.  It is often useful to make as many of your variables as possible as `final`.  
We will talk about this in more detail in future lessons.
